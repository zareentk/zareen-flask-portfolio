Welcome to the portfolio website for Team 1 of the Pipelining Penguins Pod (22.SUM.17)!<br />

## Inspiration :penguin:

There is also a Contact page in which you can contact any of the three team members.

## Building Process :hammer_and_wrench:

To build the website, we used:
- Python, Flask - Template Inheritance, Block Content, Routing and Variable Rules
- HTML, CSS - Structure and Styling Layouts

## Installation

You will need python3 and pip for this installation process.

### Install the virtual environment

```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Flask
Install Flask inside the activated environment using pip(Flask is installed automatically with all the dependencies.):
```
pip install Flask
```

### To Use

Create a .env file using the example.env template

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
The terminal will provide an address for you to view the website in a browser.
